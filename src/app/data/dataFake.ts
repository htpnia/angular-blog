  "title": "Tips to welcome your New Cat",
  "description": "Congratulations! You have just begun a relationship that's bound to be filled with fun and affection. By starting off on the right foot, you can cut short that rocky adjustment period most new relationships go through. Go slowly at first. A new cat may need seven to fourteen days to relax into her new environment. Save meet-and-greets with friends, neighbors and relatives until the cat is eating and eliminating on a normal schedule.Offer her a safe place to hide while she gets her bearings. She'll appreciate the chance to observe her new family's routine from a small, dark space or one high above the action. Bring your new feline to a caring veterinarian for a wellness exam within one week after adoption. Provide the same diet she had at the shelter at least for the first week or two. If you wish to switch to a different flavor or brand, slowly make the switch over one to two weeks, starting with a quarter ration of the new food mixed into the old favorite. From there, up the ratio of new to old about 10% each day. Set up a litter box in a quiet, low-traffic area. Unsure of what litter to use? The majority of cats prefer fine grain clumping litter. Try that first unless the new adoptee is so young that she is in the litter-eating stage. Non-clumping litter is recommended for kittens under ten weeks of age. Cats must scratch, so make sure to provide yours with a sturdy, rough-textured scratching post to save wear and tear on furniture. Cat manicures every ten to fourteen days also help reduce damage. Cat-proof your home before giving your new feline run of the house. Put away harsh cleaning products, human medications and household poisons. Re-home any poisonous houseplants. And if the newcomer is a kitten, lock away any breakables and remember to keep the toilet lid down.  Once settled in, a young cat or kitten will be eager to play. Stock up on interactive toys such as feather wands and kitty fishing poles to engage attention and direct energies toward a positive pursuit. Ready a comfortable cat perch on a sunny window sill – if it overlooks the birdfeeder, all the better! Observing live birds and squirrels beats out kitty videos any day.",

  "title": "Cat collars – yes or no?",
  "description": "There are lots of reasons why you might think about buying a collar for your cat – from protecting against fleas to making your cat look ‘owned’ and well looked after. However, there are often better ways to tackle these issues. So, what are the alternatives? According to Cats Protection, International Cat Care and PDSA, collars are no longer needed for identification because you can now get your cat microchipped. Once your cat’s microchip has been fitted by your vet, all you’ll need to do is keep your contact details up-to-date with the microchip database company. Unlike dogs, microchipping pet cats is not compulsory. However, many animal welfare organisations are pushing for this to be made law. If the argument of protecting wildlife shows up, because some owners want to minimise the number of birds and other wildlife their cats catch. The RSPB has shown that attaching a tinkly bell to the cat’s collar can reduce the number of birds which cats catch, however, Cats Protection advises: 'While you might want to attach a dangling item, like a bell or ID tag, this isn't advised. Cats are at risk of trapping small items in fences or small areas, often resulting in injury.'",

"title":"Can I keep my indoor/outdoor cat inside only?",
"description":"Your instincts as a pet parent have likely told you that, and every evening when you call your cat in for the night, you probably have a momentary twinge of worry: 'Where is he? What if something happened to him?' Once you ensure your kitty is safe inside your home all night and day, you will start to feel more secure. Your cat will likely benefit from the change, too. Cats who stay indoors have longer lifespans than those who are left to roam outdoors. In her article, Should You Let Your Cat Go Outdoors? Jacque Lynn Shultz from the ASPCA notes that indoor-only cats live an average of 10-12 years, while outdoor-only cats survive only an average of 2 years. This is because outdoor cats are more prone to being hit by a car; attacked by other animals; mistreated by humans; picking up parasites like fleas, ticks and worms; and contracting dangerous diseases like feline leukemia (FELV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and upper respiratory infections. So, for the health and safety of your cat, we recommend that you keep him inside all the time. Begin by gradually reducing outdoor time. Start by allowing shorter outdoor periods each day and gradually increasing the time your cat spends indoors, make the indoor environment stimulating and enriching. Offer interactive toys, scratching posts, climbing trees, and puzzle feeders to keep your cat mentally and physically engaged and designate safe and comfortable areas for your cat. Provide cozy beds, blankets, and hideaways where your cat can retreat and feel secure.",

"title":"Must-Know household hazards for cats",
"description":"Household hazards for cats can range from seemingly innocuous items to potentially life-threatening substances or situations. Many common household plants like lilies, poinsettias, and philodendrons can be toxic to cats if ingested. Ingestion can lead to gastrointestinal upset, vomiting, diarrhea, and in severe cases, organ damage or failure. Certain human foods like chocolate, onions, garlic, grapes, raisins, alcohol, caffeine, and some artificial sweeteners (e.g., xylitol) are toxic to cats and can cause digestive issues, organ damage, or even be fatal. Cleaning agents, detergents, disinfectants, and other household chemicals can be hazardous to cats if ingested or inhaled. Exposure can cause irritation, burns, respiratory issues, or poisoning. Cats are often curious and may play with or ingest small objects like rubber bands, hair ties, sewing needles, or small toys. These items can cause choking, intestinal blockages, or other serious health issues. Cats may chew on electrical cords, which can result in electric shock or burns. It's important to secure cords and provide safe alternatives for chewing. Cats love to explore and may attempt to jump or climb on open windows or balconies. This poses a risk of falling and injury.",
